## I. Introduction

Hexo is a fast, simple, and efficient blogging framework. It compiles and renders articles on the server, generating static pages that are then published to the internet, providing a smooth reading experience for visitors. However, Hexo's content management approach, based on configuration and text files, is not particularly user-friendly for blog authors. For example, metadata used to organize blog content, such as categories and tags, is scattered at the beginning of each article, making it impossible to offer a real-time and global management interface. Editing metadata for a single article, such as categories, tags, update times, and publication statuses, requires manual editing in Yaml or JSON formats, which are different from Markdown syntax. This presents a significant mental burden for authors unfamiliar with Yaml/JSON syntax and the Front Matter organization format, including professional programmers.

To address these challenges, I designed **HexoPress**. Its core principle leverages cache files generated by Hexo's own generators to display metadata information like categories and tags in a tree directory format on the editing interface in real-time. This allows authors to set categories and tags with a simple click and avoid the distraction of handling Front Matter data while editing articles, as the system organizes content automatically upon saving according to syntax. Additionally, **HexoPress** features a user-friendly Markdown editor that supports the Vim editing mode, favored by many programmers, making the writing process more enjoyable.

I used popular web development technologies such as Vue 3, Element Plus, and Vite 5, and packaged them into a desktop application with Electron, allowing it to run on multiple platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. I hope this open-source software enhances your blogging experience. If you like this project, please recommend it to your friends and star us on GitHub. Your support is a great encouragement to us, thank you ❤️!
