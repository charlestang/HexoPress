HexoPress is a desktop editor built specifically for Hexo blogs. Powered by Electron, it provides a visual interface for managing posts, editing content, and organizing media assets. If you already have a Hexo blog, HexoPress lets you leave the command line behind and manage everything through a graphical interface.

## Installation

Download the installer for your operating system from the HexoPress GitHub Release page:

- macOS: Download the `.dmg` file and drag it to Applications
- Windows: Download the `.exe` installer and double-click to install
- Linux: Download the `.AppImage` or `.deb` package

## First Launch

When you launch HexoPress for the first time, you'll see a setup page asking you to select a Hexo blog directory.

Click the "Select Directory" button, and in the file picker that appears, navigate to your local Hexo blog root directory — the one containing `_config.yml`, `source`, `themes`, and other folders — then select it.

HexoPress will automatically detect whether the directory is a valid Hexo blog. If the check passes, it will begin loading your blog data, including posts, categories, tags, and media assets.

## Ready to Go

Once the data is loaded, you'll enter the HexoPress main interface — the Dashboard. Here you can see an overview of your blog, including post counts, a writing heatmap, and recently published articles.

The left sidebar provides access to the following sections:

- **Dashboard**: Blog overview and statistics
- **Posts**: Manage all posts and drafts
- **Categories**: View and manage post categories
- **Tags**: View and manage post tags
- **Media Library**: Manage images and files in your blog
- **Preferences**: Configure HexoPress settings

That's it — you've successfully connected HexoPress to your Hexo blog. Continue reading the following tutorials to learn about each feature in detail.
