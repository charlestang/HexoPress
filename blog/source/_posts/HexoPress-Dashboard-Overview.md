When you open HexoPress, the first thing you see is the Dashboard. It serves as the "cockpit" of your blog, giving you an instant overview of its current state.

## Profile Card

At the top of the Dashboard is a profile card displaying the blog information configured in your `_config.yml`:

- Blog title and subtitle
- Author name
- Blog description
- Keywords
- Language setting

This information is read directly from Hexo's main configuration file. To make changes, edit the `_config.yml` in your blog's root directory.

## Statistics

Below the profile card are three key numbers:

- **Published**: The number of published posts
- **Drafts**: The number of unpublished drafts
- **Pages**: The number of standalone pages

These figures give you a quick sense of your blog's content scale.

## Writing Heatmap

The Dashboard features a writing heatmap similar to GitHub's contribution graph. It displays your writing activity over time in a calendar format — the darker the color, the more writing activity on that day.

This heatmap helps you track your writing habits and maintain a consistent rhythm.

## Recent Posts and Drafts

The lower section of the page is divided into two lists:

- **Recent Posts**: Published articles sorted by update time — click any post to jump straight into the editor
- **Drafts**: All unpublished drafts, making it easy to pick up where you left off

Both lists support "Load More" for browsing through larger collections.

The Dashboard is a clean, focused overview page that helps you quickly assess your blog's status and jump directly to the content that needs your attention.
